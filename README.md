The Mage is an adventure game where the player is given a magical ring that will
help him throughout his journey. The ring has limitless* customization and
upgrades with a wide array of enhancements and a massive skill tree that will
allow the player to play with his own style. The game features idle and active
play, but the way you build your ring will determine how active or idle your
experience will be.
